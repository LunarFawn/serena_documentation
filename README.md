# Serena RNA Analysis Suite

This is the webiste for information on the Serena Suite of RNA analysis tools and algorithms. This includes software documentation and thought/reasons for doing things certain ways.

## Algorithms and Tools

Currently Ensemble Variation and Local Minima Variation are the only algorithms with tools fully coded up and unit tested from the list of algorithms presented at the annual RNA design conference Eternacon9 at Stanford University. These utilize a new software framework I developed that enabled the processing and shuttling around of information on RNA stuctural ensembles. These ensembles are determined through thermodynamic modeling using University research software tools such as Nupack4 and Vienna2.
